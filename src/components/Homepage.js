            Cristiano Ronaldo: 'I'm the Best Player in History,' 'Have Always

            Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has said that he is the "best
            player in history" after winning his fifth Ballon d'Or on Thursday.
            Ronaldo picked up the award for the second year in a row to equal
            the record of Barcelona star Lionel Messi, and he said he does not
            believe any player is better than him. He told France Football (h/t
            Goal's Robin Bairner): "I've never seen anyone better than me. I
            have always thought that. No footballer can do the things I can.
            "There’s no player more complete than me. I play well with both
            feet, I’m quick, powerful, good with the head, I score goals, I make
            assists. There are guys who prefer Neymar or Messi. But I tell you:
            there’s no one more complete than me.

            winning the Liga title as well as the UEFA Champions League.
            Madrid's victory over Juventus in the final ensured Los Blancos
            became the first club ever to retain the trophy in its modern
            format. Ronaldo scored twice in the final, proving once again he is
            a man for the big occasion, and it is these achievements that saw
            him win the Ballon d'Or ahead of great rival Messi. Opta also showed
            how he set yet another record in Europe on Wednesday:
